Your `README.md` file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain what your project is, what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does, and if you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them.
# Parkour v.0.4
#### Video Demo: <>
### Overview
Parkour is a 2D platformer game inspired by the 2001 game Icy Tower by Johan Pietz and a favorite childhood game of mine. The game's name and character design are parodies from an episode of the famous TV show, The Office (US version), where one of the main characters Micheal Scott was jumping off of furniture and screaming "parkour".  All sprites and designs were made by me, but I do not have ownership of the character in my game, and was just made for the fun of it. The platforms were designed after the 4 elements: fire, water, earth, and air. 
### Project Structure

### Gameplay
The game features the character in a tower-like environment. The user has to use the directional keys left and right to move the character left and right, and the space key to jump. The goal is to reach as high as you can. The character is able to reach higher platforms by gaining some speed before jumping, and can bounce off of walls . As the player progresses higher the platforms changes elements, once reaching the last element the order of elements starts all over again. The game starts with following the character as they go up, but after a certain threshold, a timer is activated and the screen starts scrolling up on its own, every second gradually scrolls a bit faster until it reaches a max scroll speed.
